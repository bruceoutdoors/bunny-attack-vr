# Duck Season VR

**This game is still under development. Nothing to see yet!**

It’s duck invasion! You play as Bill: a hippie who lives in his cabin alone in the woods. Bill needs to build a fort to defend from weird ducks trying to tear down his cabin, while he shoots them off with his shotgun. After many months, Bill decides to turn his survival shooting experience to a game of scrabble! 

For each round, he must shoot out a certain number of words within a time limit, while making sure them mad ducks don’t tear down his fort. The words will earn him points depending on the letters he used, and he uses these points to purchase upgrades.
